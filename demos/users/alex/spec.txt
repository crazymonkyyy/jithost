# Alex's Tech Blog Ideas

I want to share my programming knowledge with other developers. I have lots of code examples I'd like to include.

## What I need:
- A place to write tutorials
- Code blocks that look nice and are easy to copy
- Somewhere dark colored since I code at night
- Sections for different programming languages
- Some way to organize my posts by difficulty level

## Other thoughts:
- Would be nice if people could subscribe to updates
- Maybe have a section for book recommendations
- I have some old blog posts I want to move over
- Would like it to be fast and not cluttered with ads like other sites
