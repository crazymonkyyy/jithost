# Maya's Recipe & Photo Site

I'm a food photographer and I want to share my recipes along with beautiful photos. People always ask me for my recipes and I'd love to have a pretty place to share them.

## What I need:
- A way to show my food photos nicely
- Recipe format that's easy to follow when cooking
- Maybe seasonal categories since I use different ingredients by season
- A place to tell the stories behind my recipes (like the one my grandmother taught me)
- Print option for recipes since I cook from paper a lot

## Design thoughts:
- Warm, inviting colors like a cozy kitchen
- Large photos that really show the food
- Easy to navigate
- Works well on phones since friends share recipes on their phones

## Other stuff:
- Would be nice to have a search for ingredients (like "no dairy" or "quick meals")
- Maybe a section for my photography tips
- Contact info for people who want to work with me
